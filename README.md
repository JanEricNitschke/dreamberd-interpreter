# DreamBerd Interpreter

This is the interpreter for the perfect programming language. It is made in Python, for the sole reason that the interpreter can itself be interpreted. Future plans include creating a DreamBerd interpreter in DreamBerd, so that the DreamBerd Interpreter can be passed into the DreamBerd Interpreter Interpreter, which is then interpreted by the DreamBerd Interpreter Interpreter Interpreter (a.k.a. Python).
